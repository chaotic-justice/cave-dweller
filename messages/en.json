    "line1": "Drawing inspiration from dreams seen during sleep and from deep contemplation, she uses animation and other techniques to express her ideas. Her work not only originates from her own experiences but also reflects the subconscious world of her audience. She pays close attention to the texture and metaphorical meaning of each individual frame, presenting animation as 'dynamic paintings.' Since 2021, Kagi has been creating works in conjunction with exhibition spaces.",
    "line2": "She was selected to exhibit at the Center Line Art Festival Tokyo 2022 with the theme 'Toward a Common Place' (KOGANEI ART SPOT Chateau, Tokyo).
